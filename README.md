# sf-murals Project - Frontend


This README is a two parter, one for the frontend and one for the back end which is [here](https://github.com/SeldomseenSchweig/sf-murals-backend/blob/main/README.md).


## Purpose and Process


The purpose of this project was to create a site where thpeople who are interested
in finding murals and public art San Francisco could find it, and add to it if they felt like it. The 
API that was used for this was from [SFdata](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/StreetSmArts-Murals/wg8w-68vc).
This API had some issues, the first was that I was not getting the data I wanted from the call.
So what I did was seeded my database with the data from the API. This also allowed me to add murals
to the database, which is a part of this project. Go to the site, sign up, and find some 
murals in the city, take some pictures, and suggest some links to the pictures. I will 
be happy to add Them to the database.


## Tools Used for the Frontend

The frontend was created using React, javascript, HTML, and CSS. To run the frontend, clone 
it and npm i the requirments. This is only half the battle though. You need to also have the
backend running for the site to workas advertised. React is great for reusing components, and 
I was worried about learning this new framework? language? But it was quite pleasant to use, intuitive,
and I will continue to work on this project in the future.


## Future Upgrades

There are several things that I would like to add in the future. Users adding comments to murals 
that are on the site. A list in the profile section of murals users have suggested, both apporoved
and denied. Mapping capabilites. I attempted to use react-simple-maps to create small maps of where
the murals were in the city. The formatting though was off, the maps were really tiny. If you, the reader,
would like to try, please, be my guest, I will work on it after the others.
